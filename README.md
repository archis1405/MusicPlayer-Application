## Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### Zustand vs Redux 
```
Benefits of Zuststand : Zustand is much more faster than redux and requires a very minimal set of setup requirements . Redux requires defining actions, reducers, and dispatch flow, which introduces significant coding overhead. Zustand uses a hook-based store where state and actions live together, reducing setup code by ~70–80% and improving productivity .

Trade-Off : Zustand is comapatively new so has a less ecosysyem support as compared to Redux also the Zustand is less powerful as compared to Redux
```

### MMKV v/s Asynchronous Storage 
```
Benefits of MMKV : MMKV is a high-performance key-value storage library for mobile apps that provides fast, synchronous local storage. MMKV is synchronous , extreamely fast and is best for frequent read operations.

Trade-Off : MMKV has native dependency and requires native installation and can be tricky with Expo setups and MMKV is mainly movile focused while Asynchronous storage is platform independent
